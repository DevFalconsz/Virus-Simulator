
Average replication cycles were used to estimate viral multiplication rates for different viruses. For HIV, an assumed average replication cycle of 24 hours resulted in approximately 0.0417 viral particles per minute. In the case of the Influenza virus, with an assumed average replication cycle of 8 hours, the rate was estimated at around 0.125 particles per minute. For SARS-CoV-2, with an assumed average cycle duration of 10 hours, the rate was calculated at approximately 0.1 particles per minute. In the case of HSV, an assumed average replication cycle of 8 hours resulted in about 0.125 particles per minute. Lastly, for HCV, with an assumed average replication cycle of 10 hours, the rate was estimated at approximately 0.1 particles per minute. These averages serve as approximations to understand viral replication dynamics, considering ideal conditions and continuous replication, and may vary depending on specific host and environmental factors.
