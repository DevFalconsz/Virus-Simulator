# Viral Simulation Project - Virus Simulator 1.0

## Project Description:

The "Virus Simulator 1.0" is an interactive program designed to simulate the viral multiplication of different transmissible viruses. Upon initiation, the program presents a prompt that allows users to choose one of the listed viruses to begin the simulation. Subsequently, the screen displays a graphical and informative representation showcasing the viral multiplication day by day.

## Usage Instructions:

1. Run the program shortcut, named "VirusSimulator," and choose one of the listed transmissible viruses.
2. Observe the simulation, detailing viral multiplication day by day.

## Important Notices:

It is crucial to emphasize that the calculations made to estimate viral multiplication rates are approximations and are based on averages and ideal conditions. Viral replication in an organism is a complex and dynamic process involving intricate interactions between the virus, host cells, and the surrounding environment.

The estimates consider average replication cycles and an assumption of continuous replication, which may not fully reflect reality. Specific host conditions, the environment, and other factors can significantly influence the dynamics of viral replication.

Additionally, the host's immune response, the use of antiviral treatments, and other variables were not fully considered in the estimates. The immune response, for example, can modulate viral replication and impact the production of new viral particles.

Therefore, the presented viral multiplication rates are simplifications aimed at providing a general understanding of the replication potential for each virus. Reality is much more complex, and variability among different hosts and specific conditions can substantially alter these results.
